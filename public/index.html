    <h4>Sophie Seguin</h4>
    <span class="work-title">Refugee Tracker</span>
    <p>The government of Canada contracts certain organizations to host residents as well as manage their cases.
        However, there are no ressources available to those teams. This is a database that was created to help 
        manage the residents and their cases. The database was created by Sophie Seguin. This project is largely covered by a non-disclosure agreement
        as such most of the information has been changed to preserve privacy.<br>
        <br>
        <img src="img/Screenshot (3).png" alt="login-page" width = "600"> <br>
        This is the login page. Each agent has their own account which times them out after 2 hours of
        inactivity for safeguarding reasons.<br><br>
        <img src="img/Screenshot (6).png" alt="intake-page" width = "600"> <br>
        This is an abbreviated version of the intake page. When a new resident arrives their personal information
        gets inputted into the database.<br><br>
        <img src="img/Screenshot (7).png" alt="search-page" width = "600"> <br>
        This is the example of the search page. You are able to search by various parameters including name, room number
        and phone numbers. John Doe was created for presentation purposes. At the bottom of the page, when there are
        more than 12 results you are able to click through the pages of search results.<br><br>
        <img src="img/Screenshot (8).png" alt="resident-page-1" width = "600"> <br>
        When accessing a resident's profile there are multiple pages available to the user which divides up all of the necessary
        information. This is again John Doe's account. Their account contains their profile picture to help with easy identification. <br><br>
        <img src="img/Screenshot (9).png" alt="resident-page-2" width = "600"> <br>
        This is another example of the information that is kept on a resident. Their claim process refers to the necessary steps for the
        integration. The resident account gets updated by an agent every time they meet with a resident. <br><br>
        <img src="img/Screenshot (10).png" alt="resident-page-3" width = "600"> <br>
        The integration page contains information that assists the resient with hurdles they might have before being able to move out and work.
        For example, for those who speak neither of the official canadian languages it is tracked which program they follow. <br><br>
        <img src="img/Screenshot (12).png" alt="resident-page-4" width = "600"> <br>
        The employment page, as with the previous ones, tracks the information pertaining to the employment of a resident, such as employment date,
        employer or employment type. <br><br>
        Overall, this is an abbreviated version of the database. There is also an administrator side which helps manage agent account, tracks any and all actions
        performed by agents. The website is constantly being updated and upgraded to accommodate the needs of the organization.
